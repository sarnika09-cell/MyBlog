## Features
* **Post Management:** Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for blog posts.
* **Comment System:** Users can add, edit, and delete comments on individual posts.
* **SQLite Database:** Simple, file-based database for easy setup.
* **Basic Styling:** Clean and readable user interface.

## Technologies Used
* **Flask:** Python web framework.
* **SQLite:** Database.
* **HTML/CSS:** Frontend structure and styling.
* **Python 3.x**

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/MyBlog.git cd MyBlog

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
(On Windows, use .\.venv\Scripts\activate)

3. Install dependencies
Bash

pip install Flask
pip install gunicorn # Optional, for production deployment later
4. Initialize the database
This will create the blog_forum.db file and set up the necessary tables (Users, Posts, Comments) and add some initial users.

Bash

python init_db.py
5. Run the Flask application
Set the Flask app environment variable and then run the application.

Bash

export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development # For development mode with auto-reloading
flask run
(On Windows, use set FLASK_APP=app.py and set FLASK_ENV=development)

The application will typically run at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
